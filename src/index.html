                Humans are complicated, computers are cool. Thus I use computers to better understand people.
                My research interests involve investigating how people understand and process information using mixed reality. 
                Currently, I'm working on my PhD in the <a href="https://sreal.ucf.edu/">Synthetic Reality Lab (SREAL)</a> advised by 
                <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/person/greg-welch/">Dr. Gregory F. Welch</a> and
                <a href="https://sreal.ucf.edu/people/bruder/">Dr. Gerd Bruder</a> at the University of Central Florida.
              </p>
              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                I completed my undergrad at the University of Minnesota where I studied Computer Science as well as Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, with a Chinese concentration.
                Through my time in the <a href="https://illusioneering.cs.umn.edu/">Illusioneering Lab</a> advised by 
                <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs/evan-suma-rosenberg">Dr. Evan Suma Rosenberg</a>, I discovered my love of research. 
                My work involved 3D user interfaces as well as the understanding and mitigation of cybersickness (motion sickness in VR).
                I received an Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Honorable Mention by the Computing Research Associate in recognition of my work with Dr. Suma Rosenberg.
              </p>
              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                During my undergrad, I also spent three summers interning for Xbox.
                I worked on projects ranging from Services and Operations, to Accessibility Compliance, as well as Safety and Content Moderation. 
                Many of these projects involved applying AI and machine learning in a Gaming context.

            <i>Walk Me Through It</i> is a guided walk-through experience of popular graph traversal algorithms, Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search.
            The user follows the highlighted path walking through a maze laid out like a graph. Along the way, they construct a map to chart their path by
            collecting Tokens from each room. This experience was demoed as part of the 3D User Interface Contest at the 2024 IEEE Virtual Reality and 3D
            User Interfaces Conference held in Orlando, Florida, USA.

        <div>

            The Scalable World in Miniature is an extension of the well-known World-in-Miniature metaphor that 
            enables independent scaling of objects and finer control across a spectrum of object sizes. 
            It was developed with Unity 2021 on the Oculus Quest, designed for any general VR system. 
            The SWIM was demoed as part of the 3D User Interfaces Contest at the 
            2022 IEEE Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Conference held virtually in Christchurch, New Zealand.

                    This cloth simulation was implemented in Processing by using a mass-spring approach that binds together individual ropes with horizontal springs.
                    It uses a combination of position-based dynamics and Hooke's Law to animate the cloth movement. The curtain of chained nodes interacts with a floating balle
                    as it swings back and forth. Users can interact with the cloth by clicking and dragging their mouse across cloth as if it were a curtain. This simulation
                    also uses self-collisions to simulate more realistic cloth.

                    This simple HTTP server communicates the contents of files stored on the local disk using TCP sockets. It parses incoming client HTTP requests, and then 
                    replies with valid HTTP responses.
                    Its multi-threaded functionality uses a thread pool paradigm to create a fixed-size collection of threads that are each capable of interacting with the one client.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The theme of this pinball game made in Processing is to break the dam that these beavers have so painstakingly constructed.
                    Break the dam by aiming for the diamond target at the center of the rock formation and earn points. 
                    Players can unlock the multiball by collecting enough points. When a pinball is first made,
                    there will be a trail of blue sparkles that follow it and then a trail of fire when the pinball is moving fast enough.
                    Both of these features were created using particle systems. Flippers are controlled using the "F" and "J" keys.

                    This project uses ray casting to implement the magic of Harold's purple crayon from the 1955 children's book 
                    "Harold and the Purple Crayon" by Crockett Johnson and the 2000 ACM NPAR paper "Harold: A World Made of Drawings"
                     by Cohen et al. The conversion of 2D screen coordinates to the 3D virtual
                     world is done using pick rays and intersection tests. Drawing in the sky can be done by clicking and dragging 
                     the mouse through the sky and billboards can be created by clicking and dragging the mouse from the ground to 
                     the sky. The ground mesh can even be edited to create hills and valleys by clicking and dragging your mouse along 
                     the ground. Change the view of the camera by right-clicking and dragging the mouse. Walk around in the environment using the WASD keys.

                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    These dancing ants were animated with TypeScript using inverse kinematics and data from the Carnegie Mellon motion capture database. 
                    The mocap data was used to create a looping animation that smoothly interpolates between the beginning
                    and end of the motion clip then overlayed onto the character at runtime. The pair of ant dancers perform 
                    a salsa loop while the lone ant dancer performs various ballet moves. There are five different ballet techniques
                    that can be chosen from with the click of a button. The database also provided bone skeleton information which was 
                    used to form the scene hierarchy needed to create the necessary geometry for the animated characters.
